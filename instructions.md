Create the Carousel Component: You can use a library like react-slick for the carousel functionality. Install it and its CSS dependencies:
npm install react-slick slick-carousel



<!-- taj hotel slider -->
npm install react-responsive-carousel
Positioning: Ensure your navbar has a higher z-index than the carousel so that it appears on top. This is typically done using CSS.

Sticky Navbar: Make your navbar sticky so that it remains fixed at the top of the viewport as you scroll down.
<!-- imp notes till navbar and carousel -->
app.jsx
React Router (BrowserRouter, Routes, Route): These are components from React Router used for client-side routing in React applications. They enable navigation between different pages or components without full page reloads.
